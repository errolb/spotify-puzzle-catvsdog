# spotify-puzzle-catvsdog

This is my attempt at the catvsdog puzzle on the [Spotify Labs](https://labs.spotify.com/puzzles/) website.

For some reason this works on my machine but produces a run time error on their server. I considered rewriting it to use other IO libraries (instead of using fmt.Scanf), and had already begun to work on it, but I have already spent too much time on this.

Since it technically doesn't solve the problem, and unless I'm told otherwise, I don't mind posting it. Hopefully someone else can find use in this terrible code or better yet, explain to me why this produces said error.
